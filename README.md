# Domain Knowledge Enhanced Anomaly Detection for Industrial Applications

This Repository explores different machine learning algorithms for data cleaning, data preparation, data modeling, anomaly detection, and hybrid data modeling methods for anomaly detection in multivariate time series data.
This repository also includes files to create dummy multivariate weather data and apply all the methods as client data in proprietary.
Along with that the repository also shows different visualization mechanisms as well as statistical analysis of the results.
